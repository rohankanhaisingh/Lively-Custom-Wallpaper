## About

**Lively Custom Wallpaper** is a visually rich and interactive desktop wallpaper designed as an extension for the popular [Lively Wallpaper](https://rocksdanister.github.io/lively/) application on Windows. This project combines clean UI design with real-time functionality to bring your desktop to life with a digital clock and animated visuals.

It takes advantage of Lively’s web-based wallpaper engine, allowing developers to create and deploy HTML/CSS/JavaScript-based wallpapers that run seamlessly in the background.

## How It Works

Lively runs web content in a Chromium-based engine behind the scenes. This wallpaper functions as a local web page that is rendered directly onto the desktop environment.

Once the wallpaper is selected within Lively, it launches the project and displays an interactive digital clock along with an animated background. Everything is rendered live and updates in real time.

## What You’ll See

When active, users will see a clean, modern digital clock positioned over an animated, responsive background. The visual is designed to be minimalistic yet captivating, making it ideal for productivity setups or aesthetic desktops.

Customization options available through Lively’s settings panel include:

- **Clock color and shape**
- **Text size and font**
- **Visual theme and background animation speed** *(depending on feature support)*

## Technologies Used

The wallpaper is built using modern front-end tools:

- **TypeScript** – for typed, maintainable JavaScript
- **Stinky2D** – a lightweight 2D graphics engine
- **Webpack** – for module bundling and build optimization

> ⚠️ Note: Some features may not function as intended due to outdated versions of certain libraries. Updating these dependencies may improve compatibility with newer versions of Windows or the Lively platform.
